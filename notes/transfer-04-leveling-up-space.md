# Transfer #4: Leveling up our space

## Setting the Stage

- We were a 5 person team embeded into the 45th floor of Viacom
- This is where Sales sits inside of Viacom
- We had a choice between two "storage" room, both with no windows
- The space wasn't ideal or condusive to a mentally healthy working team
- The first 6 weeks we did the minimum

## Creating space

- First we had to remove large pieces of furniture (1 desk, 1 large heavy wooden filing cabinet)
- We arranged the desks to create a central work station
- We made sure to free up the whiteboard wall

## Moving shit in a Megaship

- Megaships in NYC have 'union' contracts to move a desk from one spot to another, or to hang a picture, or to remove furniture
- Lathargic and slow moving process
- We moved the extra furniture ourselves into the alternate space and closed the door

## Space design principles

1. Everyone needs room
2. Whiteboards are invaluable
3. Working wall / Project board space
4. Lighting can change the mood / feel
5. Monitors boost productivity
6. Wrangle the cords
7. Budget / Timing concious
8. Setup can't take a lot of time
