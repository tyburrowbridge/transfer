# Transfer #3 - Expectation Management

## Phases

1. **Priming**
   Happens upfront, when a relationship is new or a project is kicking off.
   Priming is the most critical moment in time for setting expectations. If poor
   expectations are established it leads to a constant and persistent state of
   "recovery" that ultimately impacts trust.

2. **Maintaining**
   The little things that you can do on a daily or weekly basis to keep
   expectations aligned and a healthy / happy relationship with our partners.

3. **Adjusting**
   Yea, these are the shitty moments. They are the uncomfortable moments and grey
   areas that if left untreated can turn into a hairy monster with teeth. If
   expectations are actively adjusted through small honest (and sometime
   uncomfortable) conversations you are just cooking a shit stew that at somepoint
   will pressurize and explode into a shit storm.

# Priming

===============

## Kicking it off

- Product Owner
  - at all cost establish who makes the final call
  - this can only be a single person and cannot be a distributed / shared responsibility,
    unless you have a deep affinity for wasting time.
  - different than stakeholders
- Key Dates
  - what are the key dates
- add a buffer for delivery (1w) - never use that date inside of the project team
  - Assumptions
    - Get the ass out.
    - Talk about the unknowns or grey areas
    - If you aren't clear ask the stupid questions
  - Exclusions
    - Talk about the things are you are not responsible for, just to be clear.
    - IE: We are building the website, but you are supplying the photography
  - Budget
    - There is always a limit to what will be paid, so know what that is

# Maintaining

===============

## Note Repo

- Dump notes into slack channel & a repo for safe keeping
- Highlight key decisions
- For every meeting designate 1 team mate to be responsible for taking and
  posting the notes

## Meetings

- always have a desired outcome before the meeting that you set with your team
- have an agenda
- timebox & guide
- ownable next steps

## Ask stupid questions

- just b/c you are the expert does not mean that you can not ask stupid
  questions
- don't assume that you should know everything, you can't and you shouldn't

---

# Adjusting

===============

## Have lots of small uncomfortable conversations

- do not let anything pressure cook

## Right time, right place

- be aware of conversations that could be handled outside of the larger group,
  1 on 1.
- putting humans on the spot infront of their peers can lead to people taking
  deffensive and non productive positions

## Be a partner

- try to embrace new challenges that will enevitably come out of no where
- don't say 'no' or be defensive right away
- listen, empathize and then work towards solutions
